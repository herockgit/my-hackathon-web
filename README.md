2. **Dropdown Menus:**
   - Implement dropdowns using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries).
   - Hover or click functionality for submenus.

3. **Individual HTML Pages for Submenu Links:**
   - For each submenu item, create an individual HTML file (e.g., `/about.html`, `/team.html`, etc.).
   - Each page should contain a centered heading, such as "This is the [Page Name] Page".
   - Add a "← Back to Home" link or button at the top.

4. **Dropdown Submenu Structure:**
   - **Company**: Why Choose Us, About, Service Page, Single Service, Team, Single Team, Pricing Plan, FAQ, Progress Bars, Site Map, Testimonial.
   - **Service**: Service Two, Service Three, Service Four, Single Service.
   - **Project**: Project, Project Grid, Single Project.
   - **Blog**: Blog, Blog Left Sidebar, Blog Right Sidebar, Blog Left 2Column, Blog Right 2Column.

5. **File Organization:**
   - `/index.html` (homepage).
   - `/about.html`, `/team.html`, etc. for each subpage.
   - `/css/`, `/js/`, `/images/` folders to organize assets.

6. **General Guidelines:**
   - Use semantic HTML5 elements.
   - CSS should be placed in `/css/style.css`, and JavaScript in `/js/main.js`.
   - Ensure a clean, organized, and readable file structure.
   - You may use a CSS icon library like Font Awesome for social media and other icons, but no JavaScript frameworks or libraries.
   - Use the image `logo.png` for the site’s logo in the top left of the navigation bar.

No use of React, external JavaScript frameworks, or other libraries beyond a CSS icon library. Just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
